Goal(s): 
When will we have enough savings to make a down payment of 20% on a home we can afford? 

Deliverable: 

1. To be able to take the output from down payment (dp) amount from bottom section
  then spit out the date in the top section of when we would have the dp amount. 

2. Add to plot of savings a vertical line on the graph at the point where dp occurs
  and maybe this line can have a hover feature? 

3. A function where user can input existing savings, expenses, and income

4. A plot of real expenses and real income (preferably on the same plot)
  these should go back to at least February of 2022

5. Visible dates on Plot that make sense to user

6. Change plot background and aesthetics
  a. White background
  b. Minimal gridding 
  c. X axis name
  d. y axis name
  e. Good title
  f. interactivity (hover features)

7. Display dollar outputs in grid with larger/built in format (flexdash style)
 Ex: https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/nz-trade-dash.html 
 
. (perhaps another app) link the savings data with a map 
  a. input your area (where you live/work) 
  b. input where you are looking to buy a house
  c. then it shows you homes that you can afford (like a zillow search)
  d. estimate how far away you would need to move to find a house in your price range

. (this may be for a separate app) Another tab for expense analysis where we can see 
  a. where the categories of expenses are greatest/least
  b. comparison of prices at Walmart vs Aldi 
  c. Can I purchase this thing and still be within budget? 
  d. Do we need to collect any additional data for learning purposes? 
    Ex: collecting size/amounts for equal items to compare prices
  e. How much would it increase our expenses to make [x] transaction? ('What if' scenario)




Other Thoughts: 

What if we built a model into the app that could classify the category based on location, description, price? 

- Can I purchase this thing and still be within budget? 
Comparing prices of goods (one store from another): 
  Ex: Aldi vs Walmart - what items are cheaper? 


Checklist:
A. Vertical line at Date when savings amount equals down payment 
B. Horizontal line at at dollar amount that equals down payment
C. Autopopulate end year to be 1 year after the date when down payment amount is reached
D. Incorporate interest rate into monthly payment (monthly payment varies based on amount borrowed and rate)
E. Develop realistic simulation of natural 'normal' variation with user-controlled standard deviation from mean net monthly income. Greater variation should show greater uncertainty in savings growth.

# For simulations use standard inputs:
# 1000 current savings
# 4290 net monthly
# 3241 expenses monthly
# 01-01-2022 through 01-01-2028
# 60000 gross
# 20% dp 
# 30 yr 
# 7% IR
A_1. Create a data set using these inputs
